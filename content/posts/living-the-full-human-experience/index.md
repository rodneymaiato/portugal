I want to live a more meaningful life.

As I write this, I'm fifty seven years old, and I can't help but wonder if it's too late to make to big changes.

My friends say:

> Are you crazy? You're 57 years old, you've got a decent job, and you want to leave Canada to live in Portugal?

I'm not wealthy, but I have my health.

You're never too old to do anything, but somedays, it feels that way. 

A move to Portugal at this time in our lives would mean starting over again. It would mean leaving our jobs that provide a steady income. Leaving my daughter, family, and friends. It would be scary and exciting. 

Maybe it's just what we need to start feeling alive again.

## Leaving Your Comfort Zone is Scary 

Establishing yourself in Canada can provide many conveniences that other countries don't provide. Let's look at health care for example. I can walk into any clinic here in Vancouver by presenting my medical benefits card and most times never pay a cent. However, you may have to wait several hours before a doctor can see you. 

But what about Portugal? Do the portuguese nationals have the same access to health care services? What about the cost of living? Can I get a job there? Can I bring my dog? 

I was born and raised in Montreal and in my mid forties moved to Vancouver. I left a decent paying job with a government pension plan in search of a better life. I found it in Vancouver, but in the last few years, that life no longer aligns with my values.

My focus has turned to Italy and Portugal.
